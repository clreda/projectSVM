- Code the coordinate descent method to solve the dual
-> Plot duality gap versus iteration number and 
compare performance with the barrier method for various
problem sizes (vary the number of samples and record to 
total CPU time required by each code to reduce the gap 
by a factor 10 −3 ).

— Code the logarithmic barrier code to solve a small random
instance of the primal problem using the ACCPM algorithm. 
Plot an upper bound on the distance to optimality in 
semilog scale and try various constraint dropping
strategies. Compare convergence with the two other methods.
